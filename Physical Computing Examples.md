# Physical Computing Examples

Here are some examples of physical computing out in the world. Some of these examples are quite simple like Zimoun’s work with motors - while others are very complex like the CAN bus system in modern day cars. In common, they all use software to interact with the physical world without the use of a screen based interface.

- [Mutual Air](http://www.mutualair.org/) by [Rosten Woo](http://rostenwoo.biz/) – Chimes that monitor air quality and strike more often the higher the amount of particulates in the air.  The chimes also receive data from NOAA and will strike in patterns that communicate global CO2 data. Video of the chimes in action and an interview with Rosten Woo [here](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/with-mutual-air-a-san-francisco-artist-leverages-the-sounds-of-science).

- [Blooms](http://www.johnedmark.com/#/phi/) by [John Edmark](http://www.johnedmark.com/) – Stroboscope pieces made by Bay Area artist and John Edmark. His Bloom pieces are 3D printed geometric forms that have their rotation synced with a strobe to create different fluid effects based on a user controlled frequency. 

- [SAM Sound Activated Mobile](http://www.senster.com/ihnatowicz/SAM/index.htm) by Edward Ihnatowicz – From the [Cybernetic Serendipity](https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/cybernetic-serendipity-history-and-lasting-legacy) exhibition of 1968/69. Very early example of physical computing using microphones to detect the direction of sound and interfacing with hydrawulic actuators to move the dish accordingly. Video of it in action [here](https://youtu.be/n8TJx8n9UsA?t=240). 

- [Jim Campbell](https://www.jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/low_resolution_works/splitting_the_crowd/) – San Francisco artist who mainly works with light. The new Salesforce Tower in San Francisco has a [light piece](https://www.kqed.org/arts/13832983/what-are-those-weird-images-on-top-of-the-salesforce-tower) at the top done by Campbell. It will soon start taking footage shot from around the city and playing it back each night. 

- [ATONATON / Madeline Gannon](https://atonaton.com/work-all) – Artists working with robot arms to explore our relationship with machines.

- [A million Times 288](https://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times-288) by [Humans](https://www.humanssince1982.com/a-million-times-288) – Swedish artists with a few similar pieces that use rotating arms (like clocks) that move together in figurative patterns. 

- [Inferno](https://vimeo.com/130670526) by Louis Philippe Demers and Bill Vorn – Robot exoskeleton rave where participants get strapped in and dance at the mercy of the robots. 

- [Zimoun](https://www.zimoun.net/) – Swiss artist, uses motors in a lot of their pieces.

- [CAN bus Controller Area Network bus](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/how-to/a7386/how-it-works-the-computer-inside-your-car/) – The software protocol that connects all the sensors in your car and allows everything to communicate without a central computer.

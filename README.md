# Making Sense
SFPC Detroit 2019

Course Description

Physical computing is taking the screen based world of computing and integrating it into the multidimensional physical realm. Living within this analog world there is already an extraordinarily complex computer with which you’re very familiar with - you! You’re able to perceive the world around you with your senses, process that data with your mind and body, and express yourself through various means and communication methods. 

In this class, we’ll draw on our own understanding and experience of interacting with our physical space to explore how computers can do the same.  

We’ll have a look at examples of artists and engineers working in the field of physical computing, the community they form, and some of the resources they provide. We’ll go over some of the basic coding needed to get started, as well as a map of where to go if you want to dive deeper. For our in class activity, we’ll play with a selection of input and output hardware (sensors and actuators) and create our own interactive devices with the goal of enabling our computers to communicate with the world through physical means.
